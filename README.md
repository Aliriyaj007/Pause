## 🎯 What Problem Does This Solve?

**Before Pause:**
```
Impulse → Immediate Action → Potential Regret
```

**After Pause:**
```
Impulse → Intentional Delay → Conscious Choice → Minimal Regret
```

This tool creates space between emotional spikes and digital actions. It's not about suppressing emotion—it's about giving reason time to catch up.
